#Topic: A System for Multiuser and Multiplayer support for Web based Virtual Reality

#Abstract
 There is an absence of multiplayer and multiuser support in WebXR. The project is about creating a system for multiuser and multiplayer support in web based virtual reality. The project solves this problem by creating a networking layer on top of WebXR that would allow other developers to easily integrate the proposed system into their products. The project helps to create a virtual environment enabling  people to change the environment as per need. The proposed system is designed for low latency applications like collaborative workflows, massive open world games etc.
